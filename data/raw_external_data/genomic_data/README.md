# Raw external data
In this folder symbolic links to all of the raw, genomic data will be stored


Note:
This directory contains all the raw genomic data available, but in reality only a subset of this data was used in this project, since the focus was shifted to only be about assembling chromsome 10, meaning only scaffold from chromosome 10 was used in this project.
