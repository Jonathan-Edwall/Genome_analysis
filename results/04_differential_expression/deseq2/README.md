# DEseq2
This directory contains the plots generated from the differential gene expression analysis that was done using the r-package DEseq2, with the use of the gene-counts from htseq-count as input-files.

From the analyses made possible by the DEseq2-package, different plots could be generated, which were:
* PCA-plots
* Heatmap-plots
* Volcano-plots

Since the differential expression analyses studied both differences within the Musang king cultivar, aswell as between Musang King and Monthong, there exists 2 variants of all of the plots in this directory. One for the within species comparison and one for the between species comparison
