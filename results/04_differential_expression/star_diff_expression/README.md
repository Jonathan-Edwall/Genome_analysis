# Star used for differntial expression
This directory contains the slurm outputfile from the mapping of 8 independent rna-seq samples onto the masked pilon assembly.
It also contains the indices for the masked pilon assembly, which is necessairy for the mapping to work.

These rna-seq mappings was then used for gene counting in htseq.
