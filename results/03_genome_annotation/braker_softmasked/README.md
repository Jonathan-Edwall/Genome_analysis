# Braker - Structural annotation
This directory contains the results from the Braker run, where the mapped rna-seq from  Star and the repeatmasked genome assembly gave a structural annotation of the assembly

From the output of braker, additionally, a protein sequence files in FASTA-format (get_Anno_Fasta.aa) was generated using getAnnoFastaFromJoingenes.py.
This protein sequence file was later used in eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation.
