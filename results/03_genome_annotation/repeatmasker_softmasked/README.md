# Repeatmasker
This directory contains the slurm-output file from the masking of repeats and low complexity regions that was done on the pilon assembly, using repeatmasker.

This repeatmasked assembly would then later be used in the mapping of rna-seq reads in step 10 and 13 (STAR), aswell as for the structural annotation done in step 11 (Braker)
