# Quast - Comparing the final draft assembly from pilon with the reference assembly from Tean Teh et al. 2017
This directory contains the results from the quast run where the pilon assembly was compared with the reference assembly from Tean Teh et al. 2017.
<b> The output in this folder is wrong , because in this quast run, a single chromosome was compared against the whole genome assembly that was made by Tean Teh et al. 2017, which resulted in a misleading result. </b>
