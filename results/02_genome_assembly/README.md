# Genome assembly
This directory contains the results from the genome assembly steps that was done in this project


<b> Note: </b>
The output from "/quast_with_reference" is wrong , because in that quast run, a single chromosome was compared against the whole genome assembly that was made by Tean Teh et al. 2017, which resulted in a misleading result.
